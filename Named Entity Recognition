Atishi will replace Kejriwal who, days after walking out on bail in the alleged excise policy scam, announced that he was stepping down.\nA look at other women who have been CMs in various states across the country:\nIndia’s first woman CM and the state’s fourth, Kripalani was 55 years old when she replaced Chandra Bhanu Gupta to head UP in 1963. She was the wife of Congress stalwart J B Kripalani and a minister in the Gupta Cabinet when the Congress picked her as the CM. She held the post for over three years. Sucheta was founder chief of All India Mahila Congress and parted ways with the Congress in 1969 when the party split, siding with Morarji Desai. After that, she contested the 1971 Lok Sabha polls as a candidate of the Congress (Organisation), but lost. she died in 1974. Both Kripalanis were Constituent Assembly members.\nSatpathy was a Rajya Sabha member and a Union minister before returning to Odisha politics in 1972 after several top leaders left the Congress, including Biju Patnaik, and becoming the state’s first woman CM at the age of 41. She held office for just over four years. She split from the Congress later and was a part of Jagjivan Ram’s Congress for Democracy (CFD) in the post-Emergency 1977 elections, and won the Dhenkenal Assembly seat. The author of several short stories and poems, and the winner of Sahitya Bharati Sammana for the Odia translation of famous novel Lajja, Nandini later returned to the Congress and was a member of the Odisha Assembly till 2000 and died in 2006.\nShashikala Kakodkar, Goa, Daman & Diu served as a minister in the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) government led by her father Dayanand Bandodkar in 1972 and became the first woman CM of the state at the age of 38 in 1973 after her father’s death.\nKakodkar was sworn in as CM for the second time in 1977 after leading the MGP to victory in 15 of the 30 seats and held the post until she resigned in 1979. In the 1980 Lok Sabha elections, Kakodkar successfully campaigned for MGP candidate Sanyogita Rane Sardesai for the North Goa seat, thus enabling the latter to become the first woman to be elected as MP from the state.\nJ Jayalalithaa, Tamil Nadu, The AIADMK stalwart, who first won an Assembly election in 1989, served as the Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly before assuming the CM’s chair two years later at the age of 41, becoming the youngest person to helm the state. In 1996, Jayalalithaa became the first woman CM of the state to serve a full term. She went on to become a five-time CM between 1991 and 2016, and passed away while in office.\nMayawati, Uttar Pradesh, Kanshi Ram’s successor, Mayawati first became CM in 1995 at the age of 39. She went on to serve as the CM of Uttar Pradesh four times. Her first three terms between 1995 and 1997, when she ran the government in alliance with other parties like the Samajwadi Party (SP) and BJP, did not last their entire tenures but Mayawati led the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) to majority in the 2007 Assembly elections and completed her term as CM. She is the first UP CM to complete a five-year tenure and is the second longest serving CM of the state, only after Yogi Adityanath.\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"id":"BD7tyUkJZU4b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Process the text with spaCy\ndoc = nlp(text)","metadata":{"id":"hSsq9gwlZ4dZ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Extract and print named entities\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    print(f\"{ent.text}: {ent.label_}\")","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_-VZ7fvDZ7jZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1726650800371,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Prachiti Laxmikant Bhutada 21BAI1687","userId":"12785667731800154616"}},"outputId":"3020881e-6c17-47f9-9789-e68dcd9b9f70"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"Aam Aadmi Party: ORG\n\nDelhi: GPE\n\nAtishi: PERSON\n\nTuesday: DATE\n\nArvind Kejriwal: PERSON\n\n43-year-old: DATE\n\nAtishi: PERSON\n\nKejriwal: PERSON\n\ndays: DATE\n\nIndia: GPE\n\nfirst: ORDINAL\n\nCM: ORG\n\nfourth: ORDINAL\n\nKripalani: LOC\n\n55 years old: DATE\n\nChandra Bhanu Gupta: PERSON\n\n1963: DATE\n\nCongress: ORG\n\nJ B Kripalani: PRODUCT\n\nthe Gupta Cabinet: FAC\n\nCongress: ORG\n\nCM: ORG\n\nthree years: DATE\n\nAll India Mahila Congress: ORG\n\nCongress: ORG\n\n1969: DATE\n\nMorarji Desai: PERSON\n\n1971: DATE\n\nLok Sabha: PERSON\n\nthe Congress (Organisation: ORG\n\n1974: DATE\n\nKripalanis: ORG\n\nConstituent Assembly: ORG\n\nSatpathy: PERSON\n\nRajya Sabha: PERSON\n\nUnion: ORG\n\nOdisha: PERSON\n\n1972: DATE\n\nCongress: ORG\n\nBiju Patnaik: ORG\n\nfirst: ORDINAL\n\nCM: ORG\n\nthe age of 41: DATE\n\nfour years: DATE\n\nCongress: ORG\n\nJagjivan Ram’s Congress for Democracy (CFD: ORG\n\n1977: DATE\n\nthe Dhenkenal Assembly: ORG\n\nSahitya Bharati Sammana: PERSON\n\nLajja: GPE\n\nCongress: ORG\n\nthe Odisha Assembly: ORG\n\n2000: DATE\n\n2006: DATE\n\nShashikala Kakodkar: PERSON\n\nGoa, Daman & Diu: ORG\n\nthe Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party: ORG\n\nMGP: ORG\n\nDayanand Bandodkar: PERSON\n\n1972: DATE\n\nfirst: ORDINAL\n\nCM: ORG\n\nthe age of 38: DATE\n\n1973: DATE\n\nKakodkar: PERSON\n\nCM: ORG\n\nsecond: ORDINAL\n\n1977: DATE\n\nMGP: ORG\n\n15: CARDINAL\n\n30: CARDINAL\n\n1979: DATE\n\n1980: DATE\n\nLok Sabha: PERSON\n\nKakodkar: PERSON\n\nMGP: ORG\n\nSanyogita Rane Sardesai: PERSON\n\nthe North Goa: LOC\n\nfirst: ORDINAL\n\nJayalalithaa: PERSON\n\nTamil Nadu: PERSON\n\nAIADMK: ORG\n\nfirst: ORDINAL\n\nAssembly: ORG\n\n1989: DATE\n\nthe Tamil Nadu Assembly: FAC\n\nCM: ORG\n\ntwo years later: DATE\n\nthe age of 41: DATE\n\n1996: DATE\n\nJayalalithaa: PERSON\n\nfirst: ORDINAL\n\nCM: ORG\n\nfive: CARDINAL\n\nCM: ORG\n\nbetween 1991 and 2016: DATE\n\nMayawati: GPE\n\nUttar Pradesh: ORG\n\nKanshi Ram’s: ORG\n\nMayawati: GPE\n\nfirst: ORDINAL\n\nCM: ORG\n\n1995: DATE\n\nthe age of 39: DATE\n\nfour: CARDINAL\n\nfirst: ORDINAL\n\nthree: CARDINAL\n\nbetween 1995 and 1997: DATE\n\nBJP: ORG\n\nMayawati: GPE\n\nBahujan Samaj Party: ORG\n\n2007: DATE\n\nAssembly: ORG\n\nCM: ORG\n\nfirst: ORDINAL\n\nCM: ORG\n\nfive-year: DATE\n\nsecond: ORDINAL\n\nCM: ORG\n\nYogi Adityanath: PERSON\n"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Print out only the named entities\nnamed_entities = [\"ORG\", \"PERSON\", \"GPE\", \"DATE\"]  #
